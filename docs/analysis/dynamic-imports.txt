# Analyzing React.lazy(), import(), and other dynamic imports

## Scanning for dynamic import patterns...

### Pattern: React.lazy()
- No React.lazy() patterns found in codebase

### Pattern: import() function calls
- No dynamic import() calls found in codebase

### Pattern: Dynamic require()
- No dynamic require() calls found in codebase

## Conclusion
No dynamic imports detected. All imports are static ES6 imports.
This means all dependencies are resolved at build time, not runtime.
